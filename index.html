                        Hello hello, I'm Siddharth and I know that it's
                        <em>very very</em> cringe I'm learning web development
                        in 2020. <strong>I know, I know</strong>, but hey we all
                        gotta start somewhere right. I'm learning this because I
                        believe it would be very nice to have the ability to
                        build a website in 2020, or at the very least know how
                        to interact with it. My goal in the future is to
                        eventually end up in the AI field, because that stuff is
                        <em><strong> hella cool</strong></em
                        >. I also want to do something that can help people
                        <strong>but</strong> I have to get to a place where I
                        can sustain myself first before helping others. Hope you
                        enjoy what lies ahead.
